# Serial Port Configuration
# If auto-detection fails in builds, create a file called "serial_port.txt"
# (without .example) containing just the serial port path.
#
# Example for macOS:
# /dev/cu.usbmodem21101
#
# Example for Windows:
# COM3
#
# To find your port on macOS, run in Terminal:
#   ls /dev/cu.usb*
#
# To find your port on Windows, check Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT)

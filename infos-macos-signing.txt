  Changes made:
  1. Copied SDK to Packages/com.sensocto.sdk/
  2. Updated manifest.json to use local reference: "file:com.sensocto.sdk"
  3. Removed packages-lock.json (Unity will regenerate it)

  Next steps:
  1. Open Unity - it will re-resolve packages
  2. Delete old build: rm -rf
  /Users/adrianibanez/Documents/projects/2025_homebrace/checkouts/malea-neuralink/builds/
  3. Do a clean build (File → Build Settings → Build)
  4. Use ditto to zip (not Finder):
  ditto -c -k --keepParent /path/to/build/malea-neuralink.app malea-neuralink.zip
  5. Send the zip to test

  This removes the external dependency issue. If you still get "damaged" after this, it's purely a macOS code
  signing issue and you'd need to either:
  - Have recipients run xattr -cr /path/to/app.app
  - Or sign with an Apple Developer certificate
